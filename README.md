Q1- Find the student(s) who scored the highest total marks in their department.

Solution 1-> Used Window function 

with t2 as (with t as (select student_name,s.dept_id, dept_name,sum(score) as mx from students1 as s left join departments1 as d on s.dept_id=d.dept_id left join marks m on m.student_id=s.student_id group by 1,2) select *, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id order BY mx DESC) as rnk from t) select * from t2  where rnk=1;



Solution 2-> Used basic joins  and  aggregate function

select student_name,s.dept_id, dept_name,sum(score) as mx from students1 as s left join departments1 as d on s.dept_id=d.dept_id left join marks m on m.student_id=s.student_id group by 1,2,3 having sum(score)=(select max(ttl) from (select s2.student_id,sum(score) as ttl from students1 as s2 left join departments1 as d2 on s2.dept_id=d2.dept_id left join marks m2 on m2.student_id=s2.student_id where d2.dept_name=d.dept_name  group by 1) as t)


Q2 â€”> Find the student(s) who scored the 2nd highest total marks in their department.
